### Artisinal hand-crafted intro [00:00]

* Our friends are [all](https://adspthepodcast.com)
  [starting](https://www.twoscomplement.org) podcasts and they're better than
  us at getting episodes out quickly :-)
* It's been a while... let's say we're going for an artisinal hand-crafted vibe.
* Only choice at this point is to claim we're going for quality over quantity... or something...
* You can see [the bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_stall) in
  our hand-crafted episode designs so you can tell they're made with love.

### Standard disclaimer [00:30]

* Standard disclaimer: here to share our love of random systems and
  systems-programming topics.
* But we only know so much! Will try not to say things that are wrong.
* Will followup with "errata" (corrections/clarifications) as we find out about
  them and put them up on (this) website.
* We do the "lifelong learners" thing, always trying to push the boundaries of
  things we know about and have conversations about what's interesting to
  develop and hone our understanding.

### The "silly" interview question [00:55]

* *Bunch* of ideas for things to talk about...
* Today we're going to go kind of a "silly" interview question.
* We've heard people do ask this question!
* Walk into the interview, interviewer says "tell me what happens when you put
  an address into the URL bar and hit enter... **in as much detail as humanly
  possible**?!"
* Probably not going to cover a lot of things, we're shooting for ~1 hour,
  **everybody listening will know a bunch more than we do about these things**,
  so tweet [@TLBHit](https://twitter.com/tlbhit) with more juicy details we can
  note in the show notes or in a future episode.
* Not going to start from Maxwell's equations / SPICE simulations of
  transistors, gonna start a *little* higher than that.

### Timeless questions [01:55]

* Related story: when working on chipsets @cdleary had a buddy who would slam
  motherboard down on the table, point at it, and ask the candidate to describe
  how some aspect of it worked.
* Not recommended, but fun concept, in the sense it's easy to lose yourself in
  all the wonderful details of a modern machine.
* Lots of complexity comes together to make these things happen (and some
  complexity we got via the evolutionary process!).
* What's great about modern computers is how much of it is actually possible to
  understand and possibly even do yourself.
* Projects doing [PicoSoCs](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) [using
  entirely open source tooling!]
* [Open source software projects like QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU) where you can create a
  software emulation layer for an entire machine from scratch.
* Things like
  asm.js or [WebAssembly where you can create a familiar machine and operating
  system experience in a
  browser](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/issues/27), etc.
* All the visibility of modern computing systems and the fact you *can*
  understand everything down to nearly the transistors is, in a way, what's
  beautiful about working in computers
* But *just* as importantly you don't *need* to know it all to use them well --
  we have these nice abstraction layers and you can keep diving down into the
  layer that interests you and snowball-up more knowledge and capabilities as
  you go.
* This is really the power of abstraction!
* So this interview question is well trodden in a sense and can apply to many
  different fields, adapted to different areas.
* Everybody has to deal in abstraction, one of the few fundamental human
  faculties.
* [Hume had described a few different fundamental
  ways](https://iep.utm.edu/hume-ima/#SH3b) that humans come up with things
  like imagination, abstraction, and such.
* Related: [powers of ten video from
  1977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0): shows expanding scale
  from a cell on somebody's hand up to the highest abstractions in the universe
  and down the smallest ones all in one dialog/visualization. Fun and
  enlightening!
* Both abstraction and decomposing things into the smallest pieces you can both
  fun ways to learn.

### What was the question again? [04:15]

* Back to the fun question for today!
* What happens when you go to the browser's address bar, type "https://tlbh.it"
  and then hit enter.
* Have to start with the keypress, you pressed enter!
* Out in physical world before physical I/O becomes digital I/O.
* Some of us are familiar with this basic concepts from
  [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron) (or [Tron:
  Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy), or its [Draft Punk
  soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy_(soundtrack))), all of
  which will be helpful.

### Starting in physical IO space [04:50]

* Keyboards! Fundamental component of computer I/O design e.g. for input of
  text (still more popular than footpedals).
* All also (conceptually) based on switches! Just like internals of computer
  are based on switches -- took the idea and put them both inside the computer
  but also underneath your fingertips.
* Going to go with mechanical keyboards because they're enjoyable, make a
  beautiful clacky noise.
* Very classic keyboard was the [IBM Model M  keyboard](https://youtu.be/D7wmMZmMinM?t=212)
  (@cdleary had one of those!), had a "buckling spring" design -- buckling
  caused switch to close.
* Modern keyboards instead have [a little plastic "leaf" that prevents
  electrical connectivity](https://youtu.be/vLGklanzQIc?t=59), when you move it
  out of the way with your finger press electrical connectivity is established.
  Switch action: on/off, controlled by your finger.
* Keyboard has a little microcontroller inside of it, it's looking for things
  that get pressed, usually done through a ["general purpose input/output pin"
  (GPIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output).
* Microcontrollers can look at voltages / whether things are connected to it in
  order to ask "is this a zero or a one right now" via these GPIO pins. Some of
  them are configured to read (to look for a 0 or 1 voltage level and say which
  one is currently observed when it's sampled by the microcontroller).
* Microcontroller reads these lines, then figures out what key (or set of keys)
  are pressed based on the 1s and 0s lines for the GPIO input lines that are 1s
  going to the microcontroller.
* So in our case, it sees the row/column activated means that the "enter" key
  is pressed (because that's what the row and column I see "map to" in its
  firmware running on the microcontroller).

### How can we relate this back to Tron though? [06:40]

* This is the grid from Tron presumably? And the lightcycles will need to come
  in to take us to the computer proper.
* Gotta send stuff over to the computer!
* In modern era USB devices talk this standard USB Human Interface Device (HID)
  protocol that's layered on top of USB transactions.
* What you do is send packets to a *standard driver* inside of your computer
  that knows how to talk to these human interface devices.
* Good we've standardized on at least how keyboards and mice tend to work at
  this point in computer history. (Joysticks: let's not go there.)

### Brief intro to USB [07:15]

* USB is a neat, modern, minimal-number-of-wires protocol for peripherals
  talking to computers.
* What you do is wiggle these differential transmission lines -- in order to
  get good signal integrity there's common ways to do these protocols for
  things talking over wires to computers (differential transmission, NRZI &
  long-term-balanced balanced codings, etc).
* You're able to wiggle these transmission lines at pretty high speeds these
  days -- lots of work has gone into figuring out how to make the minimal
  number of wires to go quickly when toggling between zeros and ones.
* @cdleary only knows about low(/full/high) speed USB from a random project I
  had worked on in the past, USB 3 may be interestingly different to achieve
  such high speeds.
* Serial engine that turns signals into packets and packets turn into
  transactions, OSI-style model of different layers of the communication
  protocol pieces.
* Few different types of transfers in USB: keyboard firmware going to shove
  scan code into interrupt transfer that goes to the host, and that goes out to
  the host, on the wire (via the lightcycle :-)

### Enter vs return? [08:30]

* Is there a difference between enter and return? `^M` vs `^V` say? [ed: are "return" and "enter" keys meaningfully different?!]
* Remapped keyboard for caps lock to be "return" (whereas my normal key is "enter") and it seemed to do the same thing, so not sure where it makes a difference.
* @jfbastien remaps caps lock to be escape, traditional vi vs emacs difference?
* @cdleary couldn't figure out how to undo the mapping.
* Classic interview question where answer is ":q".

### Into the chipset [09:05]

* Now we're getting to the motherboard "chipset": it's called a chipset because it's literally a set of chips, the little rectangles with the black epoxy and logos on top
* There's a thing inside of your "motherboard" (big green Printed Circuit Board with all the chips on it inside of your computer)
* Called the "southbridge": talks to computer peripherals, things you're going to plug into your computer to interact with the CPU / core complex
* You can see the term "bridge" here, it's "bridging" or turning other ways of communicating *into* something the CPU core complex understands more natively like PCIe reads and writes
* One of the things that usually lives in the southbridge is a USB "host controller"
* USB host controller is going to help talk to all the USB devices that you might plug into your computer
* The USB host controller talks to the USB devices over the wires that are plugged in from USB on one "side", and talks PCIe to the CPU on the other "side", over memory writes/reads to addresses that get configured on boot: this is the part that interfaces with the CPU / core complex
* The writes that get routed from the USB host controller towards the core complex may have to go through a device MMU, or IOMMU, which can prevent wild writes from devices to arbitrary physical memory locations -- notably this IOMMU can have a TLB for fast caching of address translation -- for places we write to frequently we'll likely get TLB hits! 
* Things like DMA (Direct Memory Access) can happen through the PCIe-side connections [where peripherals can dump things directly into the same address space observed by the CPU]
* USB host controller is going to need to inform the CPU about the interrupt (with the keypress payload) that came in from the keyboard peripheral so it can handle it appropriately
* Standard PCIe interrupts (e.g. MSI-X) are just little write packets that happen over an address space to a memory location
* Those get serialized over the PCIe wires
* Those get serviced in a (coalesced) interrupt handler inside of the CPU
  * So I'll say "hey CPU I have something that I need to tell you about / need you to do, I'm a peripheral"
  * Then the kernel will come pick up that note (which has been written to a memory location) inside of the "bottom half" interrupt handler
  * Kernel breaks interrupt handling into two pieces: bottom half and top half
  * Bottom half just quickly tries to handle "oh there's something here, let me make a note of that"
  * Top half comes along and tries to actually do the work when there's time
  * Instead of keeping interrupts masked for a really long time will punt things to happen in the top half in a kernel process, so that's just a software architecture / terminology thing
* Ultimately events are pushed through file descriptors (in our particular case), as a record that indicates "hey there's an event that happened on this input device of this type with this code and it had some value associated with it" -- usually this data record is a "triple" for the input device drivers

### Why are input events exposed through file descriptors? [12:00]

* Why are events pushed as file descriptors?
* A bit odd that when you put a key on the keyboard there's files involved *with your keyboard*
* Is it because everything in UNIX style is a file descriptor?
* Guess it makes it easy to handle these types of functions like select/poll/epoll to have files, but why is it fundamentally?
* Right, kernel is trying to expose everything in a uniform way
* Could have just arbitrary memory locations that are changing that are accessible to programs in userspace
* OR could use this already existing abstraction of a file to talk about things that have happened and then people can look at files
* In Linux kernel example is something like SysFS are ways to askthe kernel about arbitrary properties like "what is the connectivity of my devices"
* Lots of things riding on this filesystem abstraction concept

[Note: for low latency communication between peripherals and userspace folks often do map registers from the device's PCIe memory space directly into userspace (as uncacheable memory) and have a protocol for interacting with the device so that you don't need to go through filesystem syscall overheads, folks are continuing to try to build reusable abstractions for this like `io_uring`.]

### Through the window manager to the browser-UI-owning process [~12:15]

* In our particular case we'll notice the interrupt came from the keyboard device
* We'll serve it up to the driver which will push that event over that file descriptor
* Kernel produces a keycode
* If you're running X11 / Xorg based window manager the X server is going to translate the keycode into a symbol (which is basically just a fancy keycode but at the X11 abstraction layer)
* The X server will do a file descriptor event loop to look for these keycodes that are happening and push them to various windows which might be looking for what's happening with the keyboard
* Thread that spins and waits for these notifications and then decides what to do when events come in
* Like JF said, something like a select or an epoll would happen where you get woken up when a file descriptor it's watching gets updated
* You see the input you notify the X client which is a window of some kind (in this case the browser window), it'll be informed that an enter has been pressed
* So now that event that has been pushed to the browser window has to be handled by the browser process (which is the window-manager-connected application)
* Browser has a "thing" (i.e. client handle) that connects to the window manager and it gets the event
* Browser notices that the URL bar widget inside of the "browser chrome" -- which is the part of the browser that's not the content being displayed by a web page but that part that's wrapped around the content displayed by a web page -- is the thing that has focus
* Fun fact! In Firefox the widgets were even implemented with a web-like technology called XUL that uses XML based widget descriptions and JavaScript event handlers
* So `onKeyPress` event you'd use in a web page  is also generated for the URL bar widget
* Reuse across content and chrome inside of the Firefox browser architecture
* Similar things happen for native widget toolkits as well
* This "chrome" is part of the root window for the process
* But modern browsers have processes that manage groups of tabs for isolation
  so things like crashes are not effecting all web pages running inside of the
  project, that's been done through various initiatives like electrolysis in
  Firefox.

### Which parts of the browser might share a process? [~15:15]

* Interesting: what parts of the browser are sharing across processes?
* [Chris Palmer presentation at
  Enigma](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/palmer)
  talking about how sandboxing works for Chrome.
* One process for browser root, one for GPU process, bunch of separate
  renderer, networking, storage processes.
* Evolved over time which parts have their own process or not.
* Sometimes will put things in the same process to save resources.
* ...thousands of tabs maybe, but don't want thousands of processes!
* Interesting tradeoff that they do.

### Inter-Process Communication patterns [16:20]

* Classic question of how do you when you split things into processes, how do
  you not pay the penalty; e.g. retain fast communication even though we
  separated them into process isolated bits.
* Interesting part of the design of a browser (or a general multi-process
  application architecture!).
* When you can have asynchrony you can have but but when you want fast
  communication between processes how do you avoid getting slammed by context
  switch overheads

### The concept of "chrome" [16:55]

* Funny/cute that Chrome is named after the part that's been minimized / that
  you're not supposed to see!
* Re: how to send messages from one process / window to another...
* Depending on how the keypress notification is handled, may have one process
  sending to another process, e.g. one displaying currently displayed tab.
* Tell it to "please navigate to the target URL because enter was pressed".
* Cross-process messaging potentially, can be done in a bunch of ways!
* Can use something like pipes, but in a lot of cases you want to use something
  like shared memory.
* Shared memory itself is really neat, and *not just* because it involves TLB
  hits!
* Also shared memory is an interesting way that two processes can share
  physical pages at (potentially) different virtual addresses.
* Interesting: shared memory is not something that C/C++ acknowledge really
  exist in the machine model.
* Same way in C/C++ before C++11, threads didn't exist in the abstract machine
  model described by the language.
* In *reality* they exist of course, but question of what's directly addressed
  by language semantics / model.
* The way it's modeled right now is it's basically addressed like external
  modifications, so really ought to use volatile to do shared memory accesses.
* Probably need a separate synchronization primitive, at least hypothetically,
  to do cross-process locking say -- because needs different guarantees from
  ones you get from threads which *do* live inside of the abstract machine
  model.

### Tabs and back/forward cache [19:20]

* One thing about tabs, they have a navigation cache for going backwards and
  forwards.
* When we're updating the location -- say we're starting on a blank tab, which
  are their own entity in the browser universe, they may take you to a special
  display page or similar.
* Then when you navigate it away to a particular website (like tlbh.it) then if
  you hit the back button it may take you back to the blank tab page or where
  you were before the navigation happened.
* What's funny is apparently one of the most complicated pages in the whole
  browser is about:blank -- weirdly complicated for some reason?!

### What's in a URL? [20:10]

* Out of the whole keyboard realm, got the keys that were pressed, and we've
  got a URL -- the tab's content-frame-thingy is trying to navigate to the URL.
* First thing we need to do is parse the URL that the user wrote.
* Perhaps surprising that URL parsing ain't easy!
* First thing you do is look at the protocol if one is specified; e.g. if you
  wrote `https://`. If you didn't the browser usually infers a protocol.
* Depending on the protocol has different ways of parsing things; `file://` and
  `gopher://` and whatever else.
* We're going to focus on the `http[s]://`, others have similar inner workings.
* The way http-like ones work you kind of parse them inside-out...
* There's a bunch of weird things in the URL; where's the Top Level Domain
  (TLD)? Where's the domain? Where's the subdomains? This is going in
  *leftwards* into the URL, assuming left-to-right text is being used.
* On the left of *that* might have a username and a password inside the URL...
* After the TLD might have a port, might have a slash with a path, then query
  parameters, then query fragments.
* All adds up to: URL parsing itself is really tricky!
* Guess things like `file://` is more of a pseudo-protocol than a real
  protocol, need to handle things like backslashes and such on Windows for
  example vs in a web URL.
* *Don't* want to just take the file path and hand it to the OS -- there are
  some paths in the OS itself that are special; in the early days of Chrome
  some undocumented things in the guts of Windows that, if not filtered out,
  could be the source of exploits (e.g. some special device thing).

### Working at places and not knowing everything [22:40]

* Funny to work for a browser company (Mozilla in @cdleary's case) but mostly
  because of working on the JS engine learn things as they pertain to that one
  part that @cdleary had worked on.
* Learn maybe about some of the interfacing parts, like how DOM nodes get
  reflected into JS objects or how interop with the browser-level cycle
  collector is supposed to do.
* Similar working for a GPU company where you're primarily working on CPU
  oriented things, still probably can't adequately describe how the rendering
  pipeline for a GPU.
* Everybody has these interesting blind spots that can be counterintuive given
  their work experience, where everybody is going through the [xkcd "mentos and
  coke: you're one of the lucky 10,000 people to be learning this fact
  today"](https://xkcd.com/1053/) experiences over and over again...
* Notion that Isaac Newton was perhaps the last person to know all of human
  knowledge at one time.
* Who was even the last person to know all of CS?
* Kind of winging this interview question so far, not sure how interviewer
  would feel about our answer...
* Our hypothetical interviewer could ask about subtleties in distinctions like
  "what's the difference between Universal Resource Locator (URL) and Universal
  Resource Indicator (URI)", and maybe nobody knows? Maybe was important to
  know the distinction 20 years ago? Everybody tends to say URL, and some
  people say URI just to nerd-snipe each other. We'll just ignore some of these
  perhaps lower-order-bit distinctions.
* We'll just assume we're doing well on the interview and keep going on.
* Benefit of doing our own podcast is we pretty much have to be here no matter
  how badly we do on the interview question.

### Domain name to IP resolution [24:40]

* Now that we've parsed the URL we have the TLD, the domain, the subdomains
  (none in our particular case).
* Going to ignore the rest of the request for now, how do we talk to that server?
* Have to figure out how to talk to the server that name corresponds to?
* Resolve via DNS (Domain Name Service) resolution
* `.it` is the top level domain, do we have to go to Italy? Not quite how it works...
* There's DNS servers that just map all of the domains to IP address and such
* They do more than IP addresses but by and large this is what we care about here
* What's interesting: DNS resolution is notoriously totally insecure! Done in the clear, uses UDP packets
* Going to need to craft and send out a packet here (haven't talked about packets yet)
* Bunch of things on top of this basic concept: recently Firefox rolled out DNS
  resolution over https, used CloudFlare to do resolution

### Stacks of trust and probabilistic data structures [26:15]

* All stacks of trust right? Between "trust no one ideal" where you would only
  have to trust yourself how do you stack things on top and keep everything
  copacetic.
* Not just roots of trust all the way down also caches all the way down (as we
  know cache invalidation is hard!).
* First thing browser does before it reaches out, asks whether it had looked up
  the domain name before.
* When it hasn't looked up the domain name before asks, "Is this URL a known
  malicious website?"
* Has a list of websites you just don't want to go to, will suggest that it
  looks malicious.
* Something called Google Safe Browsing inside of Chrome that's also used by
  other browsers.
* There's a *lot* of websites and the list changes pretty frequently
* Instead of local browser having full list of all malicious sites...
* Google fun-interview-tip is to read up on bloom filters. ;-)
* Originally implementation of safe browsing used bloom filters:
  * You ask whether domain is safe, it will either say "yes" or "I'm not sure".
  * When "not sure" asks a separate server with the full list (Google central
    server) whether it is or in.
* When your browser already has it cached doesn't have to do that extra round
  trip.
* WebKit a few weeks ago noted they were going to start [proxying safe-browsing
  requests through a separate server, led to a lot of
  discussion](https://the8-bit.com/apple-proxies-google-safe-browsing-privacy/).
* Interesting things to talk about in this space of how the caches work and how
  to properly check certain properties.

### Protocol changes/upgrade [28:45]

* We were talking about how to parse a given protocol's URL, but there's also
  the idea of protocol *changes* when you look up the URL.
* Thing called HSTS which can *change* an HTTP request to an HTTPS request.
  "Upgrade" you from an insecure in-the-clear to a secure connection.
* One way this is done is called HSTS Preload: all the HTTP-to-HTTPS domains
  are pre-loaded into the browser. Browser just has a list of all the domains
  that have said "I am HTTPS only!"
* What's interesting there is that the domain owners tell the browser vendors
  to always do HTTPS connections for them.
* e.g. google.com would refuse to connect to your browser without using HTTPS.
* Not google.com-only that can do that, not just a given domain, can have
  entire TLDs opted in; e.g. a `.dev` or a `.google` TLD is opted in to have
  HTTPS-only for not only themselves but all subdomains.
* If you reserve a `.dev` domain (under the `.dev` TLD) then you have to have
  HTTPS.
* If you don't have the capability of doing only-HSTS-Preload there's a thing
  called HTTP headers: once client connects to you can respond with a bunch of
  headers, one of which is "Strict Transport Security".
* If you reply with that header it says "next time you talk to me, do HTTPS!"

### Building security in, bolting it on, the space inbetween [30:30]

* It's a big stack of caches! These things are in the browser's cache, some of
  them have timers that expire after a while.
* Super complex because the internet is large, and security/privacy weren't
  really built into the Internet from the beginning. Origins as a researchy
  military project thing. Not well understood what security and privacy
  actually would mean at the time.
* Main desiderata was, we think, "if a nuke hits the Internet it continues
  routing packets to the desired endpoints"?!
* Because security features were surprising to the designers, weren't built in
  from the beginning -- even now, we look back and say "well the Internet
  should have been designed differently!", even now, as these things are
  designed we add security layers that themselves can have privacy holes.
* Things like **supercookies**, which use some of the caches and preloadings to
  create not a *traditional* cookie (where you browser stores some information
  as requested by a website), but supercookies could allow external entities to
  infer that you've talked to this client before.
* Can, say, measure latency or figure out "did you talk to me over HTTP or
  HTTPS this time around". If you reserve a certain number of subdomains and do
  HSTS or things like this, you can potentially make these supercookies.
* Security built on top of a nominally originally-insecure system and
  privacy-insensitive system, trying to fit those properties back into the
  system tend to not-always work out the way it was intended.
* Kind of cute... there's a lot of weird, odd things on the Internet that
  weren't necessarily designed a priori but rather evolved over time.
* [Supercookies] sound delicious, but are emblematic of trying to introduce a
  mechanism into a complex system and try to see all the use cases that can
  possibly arise for it.

### Surprisingly nuanced: unicode domains [32:30]

* Similarly you'd think, "Hey I want more than english speakers to be able
  to use the internet -- can we support unicode in domain names?"
* We talked about parsing a URL being difficult and that was perhaps using a mental model that URL is ASCII, but it's not!
* Nowadays the ways URLs work, they support unicode. Very different between
  TLDs. Up to TLDs to decide what subset of unicode they support. But unicode
  itself is quite complicated.
* For example, whole topic of canonicalization of unicode: for JF's name,
  there's a C-cedilla. Can write as `<c> <combining-character> <cedilla>` or
  as the `<c-cedilla>` character.
* There's also multiple ways to *canonicalize* unicode.
* So if you have two domain names that look *visually* exactly the same, but
  they are actually different characters, are they the same domain?
* To a user it seems like it kind of ought to be, but to a computer it's not.
* Very tricky to figure out whether two strings are "the same" for the
  definition of "the same" we're interested in here.
* From user perspective it might be obviously whether they're the same, but
  from a program perspective it's difficult.
* Something called "punycode" which is used to encode URLs in ASCII deriving
  from the unicode equivalent of their encoding.
* For example domain with cyrillic characters some of them might look exactly
  the same as ASCII characters. Could make something that looks like google.com
  or yourbankname.com but with cyrillic characters and in those cases they
  would be confusable.
* We don't want that to be possible, browsers have heuristics to try to prevent
  confusable URLs from being displayed.
* Unicode consortium has whole technical report on this, called [Technical
  Report 36 on unicode security
  considerations](http://unicode.org/reports/tr36/).
* Maybe if there was a secure connection there would be a secure connection
  registrar telling you whether a domain looks too much like some other domain.
* Even what is secure is hard to explain to users. "There's a lock on there,
  what does it even mean?"
* [Adrienne Porter Felt (of Google Chrome) noted her sister asked her what the
  handbag sign was](https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/634858452309831680), and
  she realized she was referring to the lock icon.
* Even the fact there's a lock: how discoverable are these properties? For
  people who are not technical exposing security in a way that makes sense (via
  education, UI / discoverability, etc).
* To some extent security and convenience are often in tension: "Wait, it might
  be insecure, click through these three different things to pass!" If things
  are *supposed* to be working it's quite an inconvenience, but it's worth it
  to indicate to people "this may not be what you're trying to do, this might be
  something very bad happening".
* As tech professionals we can see places we've trained users to click through
  like, "Yeah, ok whatever, let me through". Hard to train users not to click
  "yes" on everything!
* Funny is IE6 or maybe IE5 when you used the browser and you used
  an HTTP connection it'd pop up a dialog that said "your connection is secure"
  and you had to click the OK button or a more info button. Reverse of what you
  have nowadays! Used to have an *alert* when the connection was secure.
* Things have surely evolved over the last 20-25 years.
* Constantly evolving and growing ecosystem as considerations arise.

### Back to the question: UDP sockets for DNS [37:40]

* Maybe you've tried out socket programming before.
* Open a "socket" which is a connection that lets you leave the machine via the
  network. Can do IP level, TCP level connection, all possibilities when we're
  doing this socket level programming.
* Sockets look like file descriptors (piggybacking more on this abstraction of
  files and file descriptors).
* Create a UDP connection -- a "connectionless connection" [or connectionless
  socket, is maybe less confusing to say], not a persistent connection, just
  throwing the packets against some potential endpoint.
* Then we talk to our DNS resolution endpoint: "Hey I have this text here
  `tlbh.it`, I need to figure out what internet address this corresponds to."
* Maybe browser knows about TLD inherently so just need to figure out the
  second part...
* This is about where we're at!

### Establishing HTTPS after name resolution [38:45]

* We're doing HTTPS so it has to be secure, and we're got to use some
  encryption scheme to talk to the endpoint, to do the HTTP request.
* Have to talk about "crypto": unfortunately nothing to do with cryptocurrency,
  cryptology, cryptnomicon, game stop, or whatever else. We mean cryptography
  here.
* Generally the browser is going to talk to the server through Transport
  Layer Security (TLS).
* Start with a handshake where the browser and server negotiate how to crypto
  at each other. Server then gives certificate back, browser checks certificate
  is legitimate, using a root store of certificates (signed by Certificate
  Authorities). Someone trusted by the OS signed off on the server's certificate
  so the browser trusts it.
* Fancy math that's easy to verify in one direction but very hard or
  effectively impossible to reverse.
* Once trust is established between those two the browser users the server's
  *public* key, which is *asymmetric* encryption to establish a session key,
  which is a *symmetric* key, to communicate with less overhead going forward.
* Provides reliability on top of the transport: get a packet, decrypt the data,
  and if there was a random bit flip you would fail to authenticate the packet
  itself. Prevents people from tampering but also nature from tampering with
  random bit flips or what have you.
* Some of the math in there known to be pretty secure for now, probably secure
  for next 15-20 years. Some of the math also known to be super insecure by
  now -- if you look back at the *old* protocols some of them are known to be
  broken. Super tricky to do properly and lots of corner cases.
* General idea is to use fancy math [and a trust network] to determine "how can
  I trust this person is who they say they are".
* Layer of trust that has been created over time.

### Accelerated primitives on modern HW [41:35]

* We use crypto all the tim in browsers as well as other places.
* A lot of the primitive operations are accelerated by modern hardware.
* Same way we talk about TLB hits there's also these crypto acceleration
  facilities inside of the CPU.
* Crypto by and large tends to shuffle bits around a bunch, do it in a bunch of rounds, do some math with it.
* Things like AES, one round of AES might be accelerated by a CPU and you call that instruction back to back.
* Instructions have been added to CPUs in the past bunch of years to do things
  like AES or CRC32C to checksum data in ethernet packets.
* CPU and network protocol co-evolution going on here!
* Even things like randomness, things that grab entropy from CPU's thermals and
  uses that as its entropy pool, expose it as an instruction.
* Randomness in a CPU also one of those frought-with-peril things where it
  sounds good but how do you verify it's actually random, doesn't have a bias
  or anything else, hasn't been tampered with, lots of tricky stuff.

### A little sumpthin server-side [47:25]

* Now we have the server looking at the path that was requested.
* Eventually the request -- the HTTP GET request -- arrived for the base URL of our
  website (the content at `/`).
* Server gets that request, sees its HTTPS, tries to figure out what it's
  supposed to do in order to serve up this request, for whatever the base page
  is.
* If you've tried to write web servers, perhaps using a web server *framework*,
  what you'll do is configure *routes*, those routes will cause certain things
  to happen within the server process to serve that request on that particular
  path.
* If I did `/foo` I might invoke a `FooHandler` that kicks in as a function
  that serves the connection that was made from this client.
* Beyond that you can do things like keep persistent connections and things
  like this, but basic query-response model is HTTP GET which has a complete
  response with a data payload.
* Responses also have status codes, you'll be familiar with HTTP 404. :-)
  * Informational responses: 100-199
  * Successful responses: 200-299
  * Redirects: 300-399
  * Client errors: 400-499
  * Server errors: 500-599
* JF's personal favorite, HTTP 418 "I'm a teapot".

### Signoff [56:10]

* Took a while to record this "episode 2", hope we take less time to record the next one
* If people have questions/answers/comments / things they want us to talk about
  / errata to suggest hit us up on [Twitter @TLBHit](https://twitter.com/TLBhit).
* We don't know how email works
* Whole nother episode, how does email work
* Every program has to grow until it does email
